abstract


The Non-Aligned Movement is the largest grouping of states engaged on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues, comprising more than two-thirds of the membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This article examines the ways in which the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) could regain its "old" reputation and offer a new agenda that better corresponds to the post-Cold War world order. Even though the Cold War ended almost three decades ago and the notion of non-alignment has seemingly lost its relevance in the international arena, the NAM is still functioning and retains important potential for uniting a significant number of countries from the Global South. In addition to persistent issues that continue to put pressure on members of the NAM, new challenges have arisen that require the stable existence of meaningful alliances equipped with the necessary organizational flexibility and capability to adjust to the contemporary international environment. The NAM's adjusted agenda for the contemporary world order implies enhanced North−South dialogue, improved South−South cooperation and a more efficient decision-making process achieved through restructuring its internal institutional framework.

CHAPTER 1
					INTRODUCTION	
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
The NAM is an international forum of 120 developing countries that believe in the idea of non-alignment with the major power blocs.
 It was established in 1961 in Belgrade, former Yugoslavia under the leadership of the then Indian Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,
 President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser and the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito.

In the aftermath of the Second World War and the decolonisation process, many countries in the developing world in Asia and Africa felt the need for a strong
 movement towards securing peace and prosperity and establishing security for all countries.
This was when the world was divided into two power blocs, that of the USA and the Soviet Union, especially after the signing of the NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Most of these countries felt the need for mutual cooperation and coordination with respect to not formally aligned with or against any of the power blocs.
The collapse of colonialism and the cold war led to the need for improved coordination among the Global South.
It is interesting to note that the term ‘third world’ arose during the cold war era to denote countries that were not aligned to either of the two power blocs.
						CHAPTER 2
SERVICES AND TOOLS REQUIRED
One of the chief objectives of NAM was “to create an independent path in world politics that would not result in member States becoming pawns in the struggles between the major powers.”

The three elements that define the approach of the organisation are:

Right of independent judgement
Struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism
Use of moderation in relations with all big powers
In the current times, an objective of the organisation is restructuring the international economic order.
NAM espouses ideals such as the right to self-determination, anti-apartheid, anti-colonialism, national independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations,
 anti-imperialism in all forms, non-adherence to multilateral military pacts, disarmament, against racism, against foreign occupation and domination, peaceful coexistence among all countries, strengthening the UN, 
no use of threat of force in international relations, socio-economic development, etc.
       	 	 	             CHAPTER 3 
	             PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
	
Respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and International Law.

 Respect for sovereignty, sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all States.
Recognition of the equality of all races, religions, cultures and all nations, both big and small.

Promotion of a dialogue among peoples, civilizations, cultures and religions based on the respect of religions, their symbols and values, the promotion and the consolidation of tolerance and freedom of belief.

Respect for and promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the effective implementation of the right of peoples to peace and development.

 Respect for the equality of rights of States, including the inalienable right of each State to determine freely its political, social, economic and cultural system, without any kind of interference whatsoever from any other State.

Reaffirmation of the validity and relevance of the Movement’s principled positions concerning the right to self-determination of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination.

 Non-interference in the internal affairs of States. No State or group of States has the right to intervene either directly or indirectly, whatever the motive, in the internal affairs of any other State.

	Here’s a high-level architecture for the project:

Rejection of unconstitutional change of Governments.

Rejection of attempts at regime change
	

 
      CHAPTER  4
MODELING AND RESULT

	The Non-Aligned Movement gained the most traction in the 1950s and early 1960s, when the international policy of non-alignment achieved major successes in decolonization, disarmament, opposition to racism and opposition to apartheid in South Africa, and persisted throughout the entire Cold War, despite several conflicts between members, and despite some members developing closer ties with either the Soviet Union, China, or the United States.
	These principles would later become the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement. The five principles were: mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty; mutual non-aggression; mutual non-interference in domestic affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful co-existence.

                                                               CONCLUSION
The Non-Aligned Movement has maintained voting cohesion in a puzzling manner, given the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the East-West divide. This thesis endeavors to fill a gap in the literature in explaining this cohesion and explaining the puzzling persistence of the Non-Aligned Movement after the fall of the Soviet Union. It argues that the NAM maintained cohesion due to a rise in counterhegemonic ideology, as the world appeared increasingly 53 Willetts, Peter.

The second chapter will provide a narrative history of the NonAligned Movement, a history essential to understanding how the movement has developed and changed into its current form. The third chapter will examine the data with regard to cohesion and defection of countries from the NAM consensus. The fourth chapter will review the theoretical explanations for the NAM’s persistence, analyzing the NAM qualitatively and conducting regressions and statistical analyses where necessary to test the hypotheses presented in this chapter. The fifth chapter will review the policy implications of this thesis’ findings..








                                      FUTURE SCOPE

•	Support for India’s candidature in UNSC – NAM’s total strength comprises 120 developing countries and most of them are members of the UN General Assembly.
o	Thus, NAM members act as an important group in support of India’s candidature as a permanent member in UNSC.
•	Global South Cooperation – India is widely perceived as a leader of the developing world. Thus, India’s engagement with NAM will further help in the rise of India’s stature as the leader of the developing world or global south.
o	In times of increasing protectionism, NAM can provide a platform for South-South cooperation.
•	Strengthening of Multipolar World Order – A multipolar world order is in concurrence with Indian foreign policy.
o	NAM can help in formation of a multipolar world with India becoming a major pole.
